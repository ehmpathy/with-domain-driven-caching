 * a method which makes it easy to get from a domain-driven cache, without access to the query logic itself
 *
 * specifically
 * - adds withoutSet to the cache, since only the withQueryCaching wrapped method should be calling that
 * - adds withSerialization to the cache, to make it compatible with normalization
 * - adds withDenormalization to the cache, to enable it to denormalize the normalized cached query outputs
 *
 * usecase
 * - accessing outputs .set by a lambda server, at the lambda client (e.g., with [simple-lambda-client](https://github.com/ehmpathy/simple-lambda-client))
